<h1 align="center">🌊 Hey, you!</h1>

<p align="justify">Welcome to my README! Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to have a look around. Want to know a little about me? I am driven by curiosity. My favorite places are libraries, gardens, and the internet! Amazement is never in short supply when there is something to learn! I value open collaboration and communication, and I believe that when people are informed and inspired anything is possible.</p>

<p>I'm at the start of my software developing journey! Follow along as I learn and grow my skills, my awareness of the tech world, and other stuff 👩‍💻🛼🌱</p>
