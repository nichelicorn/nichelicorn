<p align="justify">Welcome to my README! Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to have a look around. Want to know a little about me? I am driven by curiosity. My favorite places are libraries, gardens, and the internet! Joy is never in short supply when there is something to learn, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to always be learning. I value open collaboration and communication, and I believe that when people are informed and inspired anything is possible! 🌈💫</p>
